## Overview of Assignment: ##

Create a Crystal Collector app that dynamically updates your HTML pages with the jQuery library. I chose to create an Egg Hunter version of the Crystal Collector example in the bootcamp assignment instructions. The game randomly generates a number to the assigned egg amount anywhere from 19 - 120. Then each egg gets a random number between 1 - 12. Object of the game is to get your egg amount to hit the assigned egg amount exactly. If the assigned egg amount is not hit, and goes over you will receive a loss, if it is hit, you will receive a win.
